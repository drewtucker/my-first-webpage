# _My First Website_

#### _A website detailing some of my favorite places and things, 1/02/18_

#### By _**Drew Tucker, Justin Lardani**_

## Description

_This was the first webpage that Justin and I made in class at Epicodus. In it we practiced creating links, formatting the layout of the page and styling the page with CSS. The links on the page lead to other pages we made detailing lists of our favorite places and favorite things._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository.
* _Open my-first-webpage.html in your preferred browser.
* _Enjoy the beauty that awaits you.


## Known Bugs

_The background image for the favorite-places.html file is not fitted properly to the page. This has caused the overall size of the webpage to be far larger than the content on the page (i.e: You can scroll far to the right side of the page where there is no content to be seen)_

## Support and contact details

_Please send any comments, questions or concerns to Drew Tucker at dtuck43@gmail.com or Justin Lardani at jlardani93@gmail.com_

## Technologies Used

_This project used mainly HTML with CSS to style the pages. We then used GitHub to post the repository online._
